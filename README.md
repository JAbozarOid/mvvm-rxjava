# Android challenge

## The task

We would like you to build an app to search for flights.

You are provided with a codebase containing a bit of code so that you can start working on the task faster. It
includes some parts of the UI, basic network layer implementation with DTOs & DI setup. Feel free to modify any file
you find in the repo â€“ this is only there to help you out.

Please develop an Android app with the following requirements:

---

### Search screen

* User can search for flights with the following criteria:
    * Origin & destination station
    * Departure date
    * Number of adults, teen & children
* Destination can only be selected after picking origin
* All fields need to be filled to make a search
* Number of adults must be greater than 1

### Station search screen

* User can select a station from a list
* Stations are grouped by country (country name to be shown before each group)
* User can use search field to filter the airports list
* Screen works with 2 configurations
    * Origin selection â€“ all stations are available for selection
    * Destination selection â€“ only stations to which we can travel from origin selection are available for selection 

### Results screen

* A list of results for the specified search criteria is shown  
* Show only the crucial information about the trip
* Make sure to handle network errors and empty results

*Tip: For test purposes try DUB (Dublin) â€“ STN (London Stansted) route â€“ it has flights every day.*

### What we expect from you

* Architecture for both domain and UI layer. Please avoid using framework libraries if possible
* Use some reactive library. Rx or Flow are preferred. Do not use Live Data
* Squeeze all the best from Kotlin!
* UI part is not crucial, we would more appreciate better code than great design in this task.
* Creativity - shine in areas you are best
* Understanding of your solution

### Questions for you

Please submit the answers to the following questions in the README.md file
* How long did you spend on the task?
* Rate from 0-10, how would you assess the complexity of the task? _0 - very trivial_, _10 - extremely complex_
* If you had more time (or if you were doing it in production) what would you have changed/improved?
* Which parts of the code would you like to highlight?
* In your opinion, which Google library was the best addition to the Android Dev world in the last years?
